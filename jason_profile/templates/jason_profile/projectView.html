				In this project my aim was to analyse rape victims in India, 
				the dataset was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/crime-in-india?select=20_Victims_of_rape.csv" target="_blank">here</a>
				the data gives us insite of how rape crime occurs not only in different states but also how different age groups fall victim of physical molastation.
				Out of all the states and union territories, union territories were filtered out and data plotting was done using only specific states where crimes rates are high.
				Matplotlib.pyplot.subplot was used to plot different states and different color lines were used to indicate different age groups.

				In this project my aim was to automate google crome to download post from Instagram, 
				for this purpose I used selenium which is a python liberary to automate browser. I made a dummy account "jbot9088" and added its credentials in a .txt file which will be
				referred to login to instagram.
				So in the video, initially, the folder is empty, then after executing downloader.py, 
				the 1st post be it image or video will be downloaded into download folder.
