				In this project my aim was to analyse rape victims in India, 
				the dataset was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/crime-in-india?select=20_Victims_of_rape.csv" target="_blank">here</a>
				the data gives us insight on how rape crime occurs not only in different states but also how different age groups fall victim of physical molestation.
				Out of all the states and union territories, union territories were filtered out and data plotting was done using only specific states where crime rates are high.
				Matplotlib.pyplot.subplot was used to plot different states and different color lines were used to indicate different age groups.

				In this project my aim was to automate google chrome to download post from Instagram, 
				for this purpose I used selenium, which is a python library to automate browser. I made a dummy account "jbot9088" and added its credentials in a ".txt" file which will be
				referred to login to instagram.
				So in the video, initially, the folder is empty, then after executing downloader.py, 
				the 1st post be it an image or video will be downloaded into download folder.
